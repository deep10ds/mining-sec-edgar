<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" align="justify"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">On
January&#xA0;4, 2011,&#xA0;the Company entered into a $400 million
credit agreement (the &#x201C;Revolver&#x201D;), which amended and
restated, in its entirety, the Company&#x2019;s prior credit
agreement entered into in October 2005 (the &#x201C;Credit
Agreement&#x201D;). The Revolver provides for a five-year, $400
million asset-based facility, including a $50 million letter of
credit sublimit, secured by substantially all of the
Company&#x2019;s and its domestic subsidiaries&#x2019; assets. The
Company has the ability to increase the facility, which matures in
January 2016, by $150 million under certain circumstances. The
extension of the Revolver to January 2016 reduces our exposure to
potential tightening or other adverse changes in the credit
markets.</font></p>
<p style="font-size:1px;margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px">
&#xA0;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" align="justify"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">The
availability under the Revolver is limited to a borrowing base
which allows the Company to borrow up to 90% of the appraisal value
of the inventory, in each case plus 90% of eligible credit card
receivables, net of certain reserves. Letters of credit reduce the
amount available to borrow by their face value. The Company&#x2019;s
ability to pay cash dividends, redeem options and repurchase shares
is generally permitted, except under certain circumstances,
including if Revolver excess availability is less than 20%, or is
projected to be within 12 months after such payment. In addition,
if Revolver usage is projected to be equal to or greater than 25%
of total commitments during the prospective 12-month period, the
Company is subject to meeting a fixed charge coverage ratio of
1.1:1.0 prior to making such payments. In the event that excess
availability under the Revolver is at any time less than the
greater of (1)&#xA0;$40.0 million or (2)&#xA0;12.5% of the lesser
of the total commitment or the borrowing base, the Company will be
subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of
1.1:1.0.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" align="justify"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">The
Revolver places certain restrictions on the Company and its
subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional
liens, investments, loans, guarantees, acquisitions and the
incurrence of additional indebtedness.&#xA0;Absent consent from its
lenders, the Company may not incur more than $750 million of
additional unsecured indebtedness to be limited to $250 million in
general unsecured obligations and $500 million in unsecured
obligations to finance acquisitions valued at $500 million or more.
The per annum interest rate under the Revolver is variable and is
calculated by applying a margin (1)&#xA0;for prime rate loans of
1.25% to 1.50% above the highest of (a)&#xA0;the prime rate of the
administrative agent, (b)&#xA0;the federal funds effective rate
plus 0.50% or (c)&#xA0;the London Interbank Offered
(&#x201C;LIBO&#x201D;) rate for a 30-day interest period as
determined on such day plus 1.00%, and (2)&#xA0;for LIBO rate loans
of 2.25% to 2.50% above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is
determined quarterly as a function of the Company&#x2019;s average
daily excess availability under the facility. In addition, the
Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% or 0.50%,
depending on facility usage, for any unused portion of the total
commitment under the Revolver. As of February&#xA0;2, 2013, the
applicable margin was 1.25% for prime rate loans and 2.25% for LIBO
rate loans, while the required commitment fee was 0.50% for the
unused portion of the Revolver.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" align="justify"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">The
Revolver provides for customary events of default with
corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal
or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any
material representation or warranty made by&#xA0;the Company or the
borrowers proving to be false in any material respect, certain
bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership events affecting the Company
or its subsidiaries, defaults relating to certain other
indebtedness, imposition of certain judgments and mergers or the
liquidation of the Company&#xA0;or certain of its subsidiaries.
During fiscal 2012, the Company borrowed and repaid
$81.0&#xA0;million under the Revolver. During fiscal 2011 and
fiscal 2010, the Company borrowed and repaid $35.0&#xA0;million and
$120.0 million, respectively, under the prior Credit Agreement. As
of February&#xA0;2, 2013, total availability under the Revolver was
$388.7 million, there were no borrowings outstanding and letters of
credit outstanding totaled $9.0&#xA0;million.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" align="justify"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">In
September 2007, the Company&#x2019;s Luxembourg subsidiary entered
into a discretionary $20.0 million Uncommitted Line of Credit (the
&#x201C;Line of Credit&#x201D;) with Bank of America. There is no
term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may
withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of
Credit is available to the Company&#x2019;s foreign subsidiaries for
use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short-term liquidity
needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit
to support operations. As of February&#xA0;2, 2013, there were cash
overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit of $3.4 million and
bank guarantees outstanding totaled $5.0 million.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" align="justify"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">In
September&#xA0;2005, the Company, along with GameStop, Inc. as
co-issuer (together with the Company, the &#x201C;Issuers&#x201D;),
completed the offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount
of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2011 (the &#x201C;Senior Floating
Rate Notes&#x201D;) and $650 million aggregate principal amount of
Senior Notes due 2012 (the &#x201C;Senior Notes&#x201D; and, together
with the Senior Floating Rate Notes, the &#x201C;Notes&#x201D;). The
Notes were issued under an indenture, dated September&#xA0;28,
2005, by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors party
thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee. In November 2006,
Wilmington Trust Company was appointed as the new trustee for the
Notes (the &#x201C;Trustee&#x201D;).</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" align="justify"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">The
Senior Notes bore interest at 8.0%&#xA0;per annum, were to mature
on October&#xA0;1, 2012 and were priced at 98.688%, resulting in a
discount at the time of issue of $8.5 million. The discount was
amortized using the effective interest method. The Issuers paid
interest on the Senior Notes semi-annually, in arrears, every
April&#xA0;1 and October&#xA0;1, to holders of record on the
immediately preceding March&#xA0;15 and September&#xA0;15. Between
May 2006 and December 2011, the Company repurchased and redeemed
the $300 million of Senior Floating Rate Notes and the $650 million
of Senior Notes under previously announced buybacks authorized by
the Company&#x2019;s Board of Directors. The repurchased Notes were
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on
the retirement of debt was $1.0&#xA0;million for the 52&#xA0;week
period ended January&#xA0;28, 2012, which consisted of the
write-off of the deferred financing fees and original issue
discount on the retired Senior Notes. The associated loss on the
retirement of debt was $6.0&#xA0;million for the 52&#xA0;week
period ended January&#xA0;29, 2011, which consisted of the premium
paid to retire the Notes and the write-off of the deferred
financing fees and original issue discount on the Senior Notes. As
of January&#xA0;28, 2012, the Senior Notes have been fully
redeemed.</font></p>
