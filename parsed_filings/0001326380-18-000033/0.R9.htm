In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by us could have a significant impact on our financial results. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Cash and Cash Equivalents</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We consider all short-term, highly-liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">three months</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates market value, and consist primarily of time deposits with highly rated commercial banks. From time to time depending upon interest rates, credit worthiness and other factors, we invest in money market investment funds holding direct U.S.&#160;Treasury obligations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Restricted Cash</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We consider bank deposits serving as collateral for bank guarantees issued on behalf of our foreign subsidiaries as restricted cash, which is included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Our restricted cash was </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$14.9 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$10.2 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> as of </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">February&#160;3, 2018</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">January&#160;28, 2017</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, respectively.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Merchandise Inventories</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units. Pre-owned video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. We are required to make adjustments to inventory to reflect potential obsolescence or over-valuation as a result of cost exceeding market. In valuing inventory, we consider quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections, returns to vendors and other factors. Our ability to assess these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well-balanced merchandise assortment. Inventory is adjusted based on anticipated physical inventory losses or shrinkage and actual losses resulting from periodic physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves as of </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">February&#160;3, 2018</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">January&#160;28, 2017</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> were </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$59.2 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$59.0 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, respectively.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Property and Equipment</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on furniture, fixtures and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">two</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> to </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">ten</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> years. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while betterments and major remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including option periods in which the exercise of the option is reasonably assured (generally ranging from </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">two</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> to </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">ten</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> years). Costs incurred in purchasing management information systems are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives from the date the technology becomes operational. Our total depreciation expense was </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$138.4 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$151.7 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$144.9 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> for fiscal </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2017</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2016</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2015</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, respectively. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We periodically review our property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amounts may not be recoverable or its depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated. We assess recoverability based on several factors, including our intention with respect to our stores and those stores&#8217; projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value, determined based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. We recorded impairment losses of </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$18.2 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$19.4 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$4.4 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> in fiscal </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2017</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2016</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2015</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, respectively.  See Note 2, "Asset Impairments," for further information regarding our asset impairment charges.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Business Combinations</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess, if any, of the acquisition price over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. For significant acquisitions, we utilize third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values for certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed.&#160;Adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are made until we obtain all relevant information regarding the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, not to exceed one year from the date of the acquisition (the "measurement period"). Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Costs associated with business acquisitions are expensed as incurred. Over the past several years, we have acquired certain AT&amp;T authorized retailers and in 2015, we acquired Geeknet, Inc. an online and wholesale retailer of collectibles and other products. See Note 3, "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for additional information.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Goodwill and Intangible Assets</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets are recorded apart from goodwill if they arise from a contractual right and are capable of being separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged individually. We are required to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually. This annual test is completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired. Goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. We have </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">five</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> operating segments, including Video Game Brands in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, and Technology Brands in the United States, which also define our reporting units based upon the similar economic characteristics of operations within each segment, including the nature of products, product distribution and the type of customer and separate management within these businesses.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In order to test goodwill for impairment, we compare a reporting unit's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recorded in the amount of the excess. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on its discounted cash flows, which are derived from our long-term financial forecasts. The discounted cash flows analysis requires significant assumptions including, among others, a discount rate and a terminal value. Goodwill impairment charges of </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$32.8 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> were recognized in fiscal </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2017</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">. See Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" for additional information. </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">No</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> goodwill impairment charges were recognized in fiscal </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2016</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2015</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of dealer agreements and trade names. Intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized, but are required to be evaluated at least annually for impairment. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, such individual indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired by the amount of the excess. The fair value of our dealer agreements are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis known as the Greenfield Method, which assumes that a business, at its inception, owns only dealer agreements and must make capital expenditure, working capital and other investments to ramp up its operations to a level that is comparable to its current operations. The fair value of our trade names are estimated by using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid by a hypothetical market participant had they not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company.&#160;As a result of our fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 annual impairment testing, we recognized impairment charges totaling </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$339.8 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$14.4 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, respectively, associated with our dealer agreements and trade names. See Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" for additional information. </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">No</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> impairment charges associated with our indefinite-lived intangible assets were recognized in fiscal 2015.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Our definite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, leasehold rights, advertising relationships and amounts attributed to favorable leasehold interests recorded as a result of business acquisitions. The estimated useful life and amortization methodology of intangible assets are determined based on the period in which they are expected to contribute directly to cash flows. Intangible assets that are determined to have a definite life are amortized over that period. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Revenue Recognition</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We recognize revenue when the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and the customer takes possession of the merchandise, or in the case of commissions, when the commission-generating activity has been performed. Revenues do not include sales taxes or other taxes collected from customers.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Revenue from the sales of our products is recognized at the time of sale, net of sales discounts and net of an estimated sales return reserve, based on historical return rates, with a corresponding reduction in cost of sales. Our sales return policy is generally limited to 30 days or less and as such our sales returns are, and historically have been, immaterial.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The sales of pre-owned video game products are recorded at the retail price charged to the customer. Advertising revenues for </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Game Informer</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> are recorded upon release of magazines for sale to consumers. Subscription revenues for our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program and magazines are recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription period. Revenue from the sales of product replacement plans is recognized on a straight-line basis over the coverage period. Customer liabilities and other deferred revenues for our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program, gift cards, customer credits, magazines and product replacement plans are included in accrued liabilities (see Note&#160;8, "Accrued Liabilities").</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We also sell a variety of digital products which generally allow consumers to download software or play games on the internet. Certain of these products do not require us to purchase inventory or take physical possession of, or take title to, inventory. When purchasing these products from us, consumers pay a retail price and we earn a commission based on a percentage of the retail sale as negotiated with the product publisher. We recognize these commissions as revenue at the time of sale of these digital products.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Our Spring Mobile business earns commission revenue as an AT&amp;T authorized retailer related to the activation of new wireless customers, the activation of enhanced or upgraded features on existing wireless customer plans and certain other commission incentive opportunities that may be offered to us by AT&amp;T. We have determined that we are not deemed the obligor on the underlying wireless services contracts that give rise to this commission revenue; therefore, commission revenue is recognized at the point at which the commission-generating activity has been performed, which is generally driven by customer activation. Commissions are recognized net of an allowance for chargebacks from AT&amp;T for estimated customer cancellations, which is periodically assessed and adjusted to reflect historical cancellation experience. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a comprehensive update to current revenue accounting standards;  see "&#8212;Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for additional information.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Customer Liabilities </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We establish a liability upon the issuance of merchandise credits and the sale of gift cards. Revenue is subsequently recognized when the credits and gift cards are redeemed. In addition, breakage is recognized quarterly on unused customer liabilities older than two years to the extent that our management believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote, based on historical redemption patterns. To the extent that future redemption patterns differ from those historically experienced, there will be variations in the recorded breakage. Breakage is recorded in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive update to current revenue accounting standards;  see "&#8212;Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for additional information.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Vendor Arrangements</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We and most of our largest vendors participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which the vendors provide us with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors&#8217; products. Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs results in a significant portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory rather than as an offset to our marketing and advertising costs. The consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. The amount of vendor allowances to be recorded as a reduction of inventory is determined based on the nature of the consideration received and the merchandise inventory to which the consideration relates. We apply a sell-through rate to determine the timing in which the consideration should be recognized in cost of sales. Consideration received that relates to video game products that have not yet been released to the public is deferred as a reduction of inventory.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs generally cover a period from a few days up to a few weeks and include items such as product catalog advertising, in-store display promotions, internet advertising, co-op print advertising and other programs. The allowance for each event is negotiated with the vendor and requires specific performance by us to be earned. Vendor allowances of </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$162.5 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$184.3 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$208.2 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> were recorded as a reduction of cost of sales for fiscal </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2017</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2016</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2015</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, respectively.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Loyalty Expenses</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program allows enrolled members to earn points on purchases that can be redeemed for rewards that include discounts or merchandise. We estimate the net cost of the rewards that will be issued and redeemed and record this cost and the associated balance sheet liability as points are accumulated by loyalty program members.  The two primary estimates utilized to record the balance sheet liability for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated redemption rate and the estimated weighted-average cost per point redeemed. We use historical redemption rates experienced under the loyalty program as a basis to estimate the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. The estimated weighted-average cost per point redeemed, used to estimate future redemption costs, is based on our most recent actual costs incurred to fulfill points that have been redeemed by our loyalty program members and is adjusted for recent changes in redemption costs, including the mix of rewards redeemed. We continually evaluate our methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average cost per point redeemed have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The cost of free or discounted product is recognized in cost of sales and the associated liability is included in accrued liabilities. The reserve is released when loyalty program members redeem their respective points and the corresponding rewards are recorded to cost of goods sold in the period of redemption. The cost of administering the loyalty program, including program administration fees, program communications and cost of loyalty cards, is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive update to current revenue accounting standards, which will impact the accounting for our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program. See "&#8212;Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for additional information.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Classification</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The classification of cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses varies across the retail industry. We include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Advertising Expenses</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We expense advertising costs for television, newspapers and other media when the advertising takes place.

Income taxes are accounted for utilizing an asset and liability approach and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. We maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the applicable taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. See Note 7, "Income Taxes," for additional information.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We plan on permanently reinvesting our undistributed foreign earnings outside the United States. Where foreign earnings are permanently reinvested, no provision for federal income or foreign withholding taxes is made. Should we have undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested, United States income tax expense and foreign withholding taxes will be provided for at the time the earnings are generated.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Leases</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We lease retail stores, warehouse facilities, office space and equipment. These assets and properties are generally leased under noncancelable agreements that expire at various dates through </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2031</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> with various renewal options for additional periods. The agreements, which are classified as operating leases, generally provide for minimum and, in some cases, percentage rentals and require us to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs. Leases with step rent provisions, escalation clauses or other lease concessions are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which includes renewal option periods when we are reasonably assured of exercising the renewal options and includes &#8220;rent holidays&#8221; (periods in which we are not obligated to pay rent). Cash or lease incentives received upon entering into certain store leases (&#8220;tenant improvement allowances&#8221;) are recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to rent expense over the lease term, which includes renewal option periods when we are reasonably assured of exercising the renewal options. We record the unamortized portion of tenant improvement allowances as a part of deferred rent. We do not have leases with capital improvement funding. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores and are accounted for in the period in which the amount of percentage rentals can be accurately estimated.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Foreign Currency</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Generally, we have determined that the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the subsidiaries&#8217; local currencies. The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at the applicable exchange rate as of the end of the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at an average rate over the period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Net gains from foreign currency transactions and derivatives are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and were </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$2.4 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$4.5 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$1.6 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> in fiscal </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2017</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2016</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2015</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, respectively. The foreign currency transaction gains and losses are primarily due to the decrease or increase in the value of the U.S.&#160;dollar compared to the functional currencies of the countries in which we operate internationally. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We use forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross-currency swaps (together, the &#8220;foreign currency contracts&#8221;) to manage currency risk primarily related to foreign-currency denominated intercompany assets and liabilities and certain other foreign currency assets and liabilities. These foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re-measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. See Note 4, "Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments," for additional information regarding our foreign currency contracts.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2017-04, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill and the carrying amount. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its estimated fair value. We early adopted this updated standard, effective January 29, 2017.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, which eliminates the exception to defer the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers (intercompany sales). Prior to this update, the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers were deferred until the transferred asset was sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use, which was an exception to the general requirement for comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes. We early adopted this updated standard, effective January 29, 2017, and as a result we recognize tax expense or benefit from intercompany sales of assets other than inventory in the period in which the transaction occurs. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, which simplifies several aspects of accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. The amendments of the updated standard include, among other things, the requirement to recognize excess tax benefits and deficiencies through earnings and present the related cash flows in operating activities in the statement of cash flows, the election of a policy to either estimate forfeitures when determining periodic expense or recognize actual forfeitures when they occur, and an increase in the allowable income tax withholding from the minimum to maximum statutory rate and its classification in the statement of cash flows. As a result of the adoption of this updated standard, effective January 29, 2017, excess tax benefits and deficiencies are recognized in our results of operations and are presented in cash flows from operating activities in our statement of cash flows on a prospective basis. In addition, we elected to recognize actual forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur. The adoption of this updated standard did not result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Recent Accounting Pronouncements </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">. The new guidance is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with entities&#8217; hedging strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting and increase the transparency of hedging programs. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We do not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Statement of Cash Flows, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, which provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues in regard to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The updated standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in the ASU should be adopted on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case the amendments should be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Revenue from Contracts with Customers</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, which sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model that replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety. The underlying principle of the new standard is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. The updated standard also requires additional disclosures on the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and related cash flows. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, which delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to December 15, 2017 (with early adoption permitted). In 2016, the FASB issued several ASUs that further amended the new revenue standard in the areas of principal versus agent evaluation, licenses of intellectual property, identifying performance obligations, and other clarifications and technical corrections. Entities may use either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition approach in applying these ASUs. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The new revenue standard will primarily impact the accounting of our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program and the recognition of breakage associated with our gift cards liability. For our loyalty program, we currently estimate the net cost of the rewards that will be issued and redeemed and record this cost (presented as cost of sales) and the associated balance sheet liability as points are accumulated by our loyalty program members. Under the new standard, the transaction price will be allocated between the product(s) sold and loyalty points earned, where the portion allocated to the loyalty points will be initially recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized as revenue upon redemption or expiration of the loyalty points. Estimated breakage on unused gift cards and merchandise credit liabilities is currently recognized on a quarterly basis (recorded to cost of sales) for balances older than two years to the extent that we believe the likelihood of redemption is remote. Under the new standard, we will recognize breakage in revenue based on and in proportion to historical redemption patterns, regardless of the age of the unused gift cards and merchandise credit liabilities.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We will adopt the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, using the modified-retrospective transition approach. Under this approach, we will apply the new revenue standard on a prospective basis, effective February 4, 2018, and record adjustments to our fiscal 2018 opening balance sheet (as of February 4, 2018) to reflect the cumulative effect of the new revenue standard. We will also provide quantitative and qualitative disclosures of the new standard&#8217;s impact to each of our financial statement line items during fiscal 2018. The cumulative-effect adjustment will include a reduction of our gift card and customer deposit liabilities of approximately </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$46 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, an increase to our loyalty program liabilities of approximately </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$28 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> and a net increase to our retained earnings of approximately </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$18 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> (approximately </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$12 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, net of tax). In addition, the adoption of the new standard will result in expanded revenue recognition disclosures. We do not expect the adoption of the new revenue standard to have a material impact to our consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Leases</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">. The standard requires a lessee to recognize a liability related to lease payments and an offsetting right-of-use asset representing a right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective transition approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain reliefs available. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the overall impact to our consolidated financial statements, though we expect the adoption to result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.</font></div></div><span></span>
