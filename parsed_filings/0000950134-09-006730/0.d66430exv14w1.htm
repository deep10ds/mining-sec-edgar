SENIOR FINANCIAL AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GameStop Corp. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is committed to full and accurate financial disclosure in
compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and to maintaining its books and records in
accordance with applicable accounting policies, laws, rules and regulations. This Code of Ethics
for Senior Financial and Executive Officers, applicable to the Company&#146;s Executive Chairman of the
Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting
Officer and any Executive Vice President of the Company or Vice President within the U.S. Finance
Department of the Company (together, &#147;Senior Financial and Executive Officers&#148;), sets forth
specific policies to guide the Senior Financial and Executive Officers in the performance of their
duties. As Senior Financial and Executive Officers, you perform a task that is critical to the
Company. This Code of Ethics is designed to assist you in that task.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct, which this Code of Ethics is intended to
supplement, sets forth the fundamental principles and key policies and procedures that govern the
conduct of all of us in our business. You are bound by the requirements and standards set forth in
the Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct, as well as those set forth in this Code of Ethics and
other applicable policies and procedures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Compliance with Rules and Regulations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is committed to conducting our business in accordance with all applicable laws,
rules and regulations and in accordance with the highest standards of business ethics. As a Senior
Financial and/or Executive Officer, you must not only comply with applicable laws. You also have
leadership responsibilities that include creating a culture of high ethical standards and
commitment to compliance; maintaining a work environment that encourages employees to raise
concerns; and promptly addressing compliance concerns raised by employees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Conflicts of Interest</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to maintain the highest degree of integrity in the conduct of the Company&#146;s business
and your independent judgment, you must avoid any activity or personal interest that creates or
appears to create a conflict between your interests and the interests of the Company. A conflict
of interest occurs when your private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to interfere,
with the interests of the Company as a whole. You should conduct the Company&#146;s business in an
honest and ethical manner, and never act in a manner that could cause you to lose your independence
and objectivity.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we cannot list every conceivable conflict, the following are some common examples
that illustrate actual or apparent conflicts of interest that should be avoided:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Improper Personal Benefits from the Company</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflicts of interest arise when an officer or a member of his or her family receives improper
personal benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company. You may not accept any
benefits from the Company that have not been duly authorized and approved pursuant to Company
policy and procedure, including any Company loans or guarantees of your personal obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Financial Interests in Other Businesses</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither you nor your immediate family members may have an ownership interest in any other
enterprise if that interest compromises or appears to compromise your loyalty to the Company. For
example, you may not own an interest in a company that competes with the Company. You may not own
an interest in a company that does business with the Company (such as a Company customer/client or
supplier) unless you obtain the written approval of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
before making any such investment. However, it is not typically considered a conflict of interest
to make investments with a total value of no more than ten percent (10%) of your annual
compensation in customers/clients or suppliers that are listed on a recognized securities exchange.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Business Arrangements with the Company and Corporate Opportunities</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the prior written approval of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, you may
not participate in a joint venture, partnership or other business arrangement with the Company. If
you learn of a business or investment opportunity through the use of corporate property or
information or your position at the Company, such as from a competitor or actual or potential
client, supplier or business associate of the Company (including a principal, officer, director or
employee of any of the above), you may not participate in the business or make the investment and
must instead inform the Chief Executive Officer (or, with respect to the Chief Executive Officer,
inform the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors). Such an opportunity is an investment
opportunity for the Company, not for you individually.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Outside Employment or Activities with a Competitor</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneous employment with or serving as a director of a competitor of the Company is
strictly prohibited, as is any activity that is intended to or that you should reasonably expect to
advance a competitor&#146;s interests. You may not market products or services in competition with the
Company&#146;s current or potential business activities. It is your responsibility to consult with the
Chief Executive Officer (or, with respect to the
Chief Executive Officer, consult with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors) to

Nor may you accept money or benefits of any kind from a third party as compensation or payment for
any advice or services that you may provide to a client, supplier or anyone else in connection with

welfare of our local communities. However, you must obtain the prior written approval of the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors before serving as a director or trustee of any charitable,
not-for-profit, for-profit, or other entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will not need to
obtain Audit Committee approval for your service as a director on up to three boards on which you
serve as of the effective date of this Code of Ethics, provided that you notify the Board of
Directors of such directorships. Similarly, you must obtain the prior written approval of the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors before running for election or seeking appointment to any
government-related position.

whom you have a familial relationship is, or is to be, a competitor, supplier or customer/client of
the Company or is, or is to be, employed by one, you must disclose the situation to the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors so that the Company may assess the nature and extent of any
concern and how it can be resolved. You must carefully guard against inadvertently disclosing
Company confidential information and being involved in decisions on behalf of the Company that
involve such other company.

equipment, materials, resources and proprietary information, must be used for legitimate business
purposes on behalf of the Company only. Incidental and occasional personal use of the Company&#146;s
electronic mail and telephone systems is permitted. However, you should be aware that even
personal messages on the Company&#146;s
computer and telephone systems are Company property and you should therefore have no expectation of
personal privacy in connection with your use of these resources.
