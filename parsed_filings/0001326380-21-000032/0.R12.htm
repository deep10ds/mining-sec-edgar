<td class="text">COVID-19 Impacts<div style="margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The near-term macroeconomic conditions continue to be adversely impacted by the emergence of a novel coronavirus, identified as COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. In efforts to mitigate the continued spread of the virus, numerous governments in geographies where the Company operates have imposed quarantines, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and other similar measures in attempts to limit physical human interaction, referred to as social distancing. To comply with these measures, the Company temporarily closed or limited store operations across all of its operating regions at various times throughout fiscal 2020 to date.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">During the first half of 2020, the Company temporarily closed stores at various times across Europe, Canada and New Zealand. In the United States, all storefronts were temporarily closed to customers, however, we continued to process orders by offering curbside pick-up, ship from store and e-commerce delivery options in many of our stores. These temporary store closures began in late March 2020 and by the end of June 2020, 98% of our stores globally were open to the public following the implementation of the highest level of health and safety protocols recommended by the federal and local health and governmental authorities. Our store locations in Australia remained opened to the public during the first half of fiscal 2020 and were not negatively impacted during this period by the COVID-19 restrictions as our other segments and New Zealand were impacted. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the substantial majority of our stores were open, with approximately 15% of our stores in Australia temporarily closed for approximately four weeks due to an outbreak of COVID-19. </span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Additionally, beginning in late October 2020 and continuing throughout the fiscal fourth quarter, as COVID-19 cases began to escalate in regions around the world, certain of our stores across Europe, Canada and Australia began more long-term or fluctuating temporary closures as required by the various governmental authorities. Although certain stores remained closed during this time, some of our stores in France, Ireland, Canada and Australia offered and some continue to offer curbside pick-up. We remain vigilant in our compliance with COVID-19 regulations across our operating regions. In late December 2020 and </span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">extending through the end of fiscal 2020, we experienced an increase in temporary store closures in all but the Australian segment, with certain jurisdictions in Canada, US, and Europe allowing for curbside pickup</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Impact on Operating Results and Asset Recoverability</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">While the gaming industry has not been as severely impacted as certain other consumer businesses, store closures during the stay-at-home orders have adversely impacted our results of operations during fiscal 2020. In response, we have taken proactive measures to align inventory purchases with demand, reduce discretionary spending and earlier in fiscal 2020 instituted temporary pay reductions to partially offset the impact of store closures. </span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">During fiscal 2020, we incurred approximately $25&#160;million in costs to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic including costs related to incremental wage payments to hourly associates to help offset lost wages due to store closures, enhanced cleaning measures and expanded use of personal protective equipment at our stores, shared service centers and distribution centers across all geographies where we operate.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The aggregation of these events caused us to reassess potential impairments of long-lived assets, primarily consisting of store-level property and equipment and right-of-use assets under existing operating leases. As a result of this asset impairment analysis, during fiscal 2020 we recognized impairment charges totaling $11.2&#160;million, consisting of a $7.2&#160;million impairment for store-level property and equipment, $2.9&#160;million impairment for store-level ROU assets, and $1.1&#160;million impairment for definite-lived intangible assets. In addition, during fiscal 2020, we recognized impairment charges of $3.2&#160;million for our corporate aircraft, which was partially attributable to the economic impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our corporate aircraft was sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 for $8.6&#160;million, net of costs to sell. See Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for further details.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">During fiscal 2020, we continued to assess the likelihood of realizing the benefits of our deferred tax assets. We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets using several factors, including the weight of all available evidence, which takes into consideration cumulative book losses recognized, projections of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions and other factors. While our view of the longer-term operating outlook has not been significantly impacted by COVID-19, our ability to recover these deferred tax assets depends on several factors, including our short and long-term results of operations. As a result of this analysis, we maintain valuation allowances of approximately $225.7 million on all of our U.S. and foreign net deferred tax assets as of January&#160;30, 2021.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We evaluated our accounts receivables, which are mainly comprised of bankcard receivables and vendor allowances. Given the nature of these receivables and the credit worthiness of the applicable payees, the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly impact the estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts. </span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We also evaluated our merchandise inventories, which are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. We are required to record valuation adjustments to inventory to reflect potential obsolescence or over-valuation as a result of cost exceeding market. In valuing inventory, we consider the quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections, returns to vendors and other factors. Given the nature of our products, our inventory management efforts and the temporary nature of store closures, the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly impact the estimates of inventory valuation. </span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Liquidity and Other Impacts</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As of January&#160;30, 2021, we had total unrestricted cash on hand of $508.5 million, $126.5&#160;million of restricted cash and an additional $88.4 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. On March 15, 2021, we repaid our outstanding borrowings of $25.0&#160;million under the Revolver. See Note 12, "Debt," for further information. As mentioned above, we have taken actions to align expenses and inventory levels given the impacts of the current operating environment and have projected we will have adequate liquidity for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future to maintain normal operations. Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed an exchange offer for a portion of our unsecured 2021 Senior Notes resulting in the replacement of 52% of such 2021 Senior Notes (based on aggregate principal amount) for newly issued 2023 Senior Notes. Through fiscal 2020, we have repaid $131.8&#160;million aggregate principal amount of our 2021 Senior Notes through a combination of open market purchases and redemptions. The remaining $73.2&#160;million aggregate principal amount of our 2021 Senior Notes was redeemed subsequent to year-end on March 15, 2021. See Note 12, "Debt," for further details on the exchange offer and related impacts to scheduled debt maturities. </span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to associates who are unable to work during the COVID-19 pandemic and options to defer the employer portion of Social Security payroll taxes incurred through the end of calendar year 2020. We qualified for the deferral of Social Security payroll taxes and, as a result, we have deferred, and continued to defer payroll taxes and other tax payments through the end of the calendar year 2020. The payment of these deferred amounts are required to be made in 2021 and 2022 calendar years. These deferrals are included in accrued liabilities and other current liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, our French subsidiary obtained &#8364;20.0&#160;million of unsecured term loans in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and another &#8364;20.0&#160;million of unsecured term loans in the third </span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">quarter of fiscal 2020, 90% of which are guaranteed by the French government pursuant to a state guaranteed loan program instituted in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 12, "Debt" for further information.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">During fiscal 2020, we received approximately $27&#160;million, of COVID-19-related rent concessions comprised of rent abatements and rent deferrals. We applied lease modification guidance to any concession arrangement that extended the term of the lease and substantially altered future cash flows. We elected, as permitted by the guidance issued by the FASB during the COVID-19 pandemic, to not use lease modification accounting for all rent concessions including any rent abatements related to leases not subject to an extension of the original terms. For these leases, which represented most of the leases subject to COVID-19-related rent concessions, we reduced rent expense in the later of the month in which the landlord issued the rent concession or the month for which the rent concession related. For rent concessions in the form of lease payment deferrals, the liability for these rent amounts will remain on the balance sheet until paid.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The COVID-19 pandemic remains an evolving situation and its impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial conditions will depend on the geographies impacted by the virus, the ongoing economic effect of the pandemic, the additional economic stimulus programs introduced by governments, and the timing of the post-pandemic economic recovery. Even as we continue to comply with all governmental health and safety requirements for our associates and customers while resuming and maintaining substantially full operations, the persistence and potential resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic may require us to temporarily close stores again in future periods or introduce modified operating schedules and may impact customer behaviors, including a potential reduction in consumer discretionary spending. These developments could increase asset recovery and valuation risks. Further, the uncertainties in the global economy could impact the financial viability of the our suppliers, which may interrupt our supply chain and require other changes to operations. In light of the foregoing, the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and responses of governments, customers, suppliers and other third parties, may materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.</span></div><span></span>
