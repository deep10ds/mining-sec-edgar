</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company&#146;s Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct, which this Code of Ethics for Senior Financial
and Executive Officers is intended to supplement, sets forth the fundamental principles and key

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In order to maintain the highest degree of integrity in the conduct of the Company&#146;s business and
your independent judgment, you must avoid any activity or personal interest that creates or appears
to create a conflict between your interests and the interests of the Company. A conflict of
interest occurs when your private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to interfere, with
the interests of the Company as a whole. You should conduct the Company&#146;s business in
an honest and ethical manner, and never act in a manner that could cause you to lose your
independence and objectivity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Although we cannot list every conceivable conflict, the following are some common examples that
illustrate actual or apparent conflicts of interest that should be avoided:

receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company. You may not
accept any benefits from the Company that have not been duly authorized and approved pursuant to
Company policy and procedure, including any Company loans or guarantees of your personal
obligations.

other enterprise if that interest compromises or appears to compromise your loyalty to the Company.
For example, you may not own an interest in a company that competes with the Company. You may not
own an interest in a company that does business with the Company (such as a Company customer/client
or supplier) unless you obtain the written approval of the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors before making any such investment. However, it is not typically considered a conflict of
interest to make investments with a total value of no more than ten percent (10%) of your annual
compensation in customers/clients or suppliers that are listed on a recognized securities exchange.

or through your position at the Company &#151; such as from a competitor, actual or potential client,
supplier or business associate of the Company (including a principal, officer, director or employee
of any of the above), you may not participate in the business or make the investment. You must,
instead, inform the Chief Executive Officer (or, with respect to the Chief Executive Officer,
inform the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors). Such an opportunity is an investment
opportunity for the Company, not for you individually.
