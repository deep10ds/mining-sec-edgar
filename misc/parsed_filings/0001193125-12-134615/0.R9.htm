accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (&#x201C;GAAP&#x201D;) requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing
these financial statements, management has made its best estimates
and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial
statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the
estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant
impact on the Company&#x2019;s financial results. Actual results

purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. The Company&#x2019;s cash and cash equivalents are
carried at cost, which approximates market value, and consist
primarily of time deposits with highly rated commercial banks. From

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company&#x2019;s merchandise inventories are carried at the
lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method.
Under the average cost method, as new product is received from
vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product
on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units.
Used video game products traded in by customers are recorded as
inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer.
In valuing inventory, management is required to make assumptions
regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially
obsolete or over-valued items at the lower of cost or market.
Management considers quantities on hand, recent sales, potential
price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when
making these assumptions. The Company&#x2019;s ability to gauge
these factors is dependent upon the Company&#x2019;s ability to
forecast customer demand and to provide a well-balanced merchandise
assortment. Inventory is adjusted based on anticipated physical
inventory losses or shrinkage and actual losses resulting from
periodic physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves as of
January&#xA0;28, 2012 and January&#xA0;29, 2011 were
$67.7&#xA0;million and $69.5&#xA0;million, respectively.</font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on furniture, fixtures
and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives ranging from two to eight years. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred, while betterments and major
remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are
capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated
useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including
option periods in which the exercise of the option is reasonably
assured (generally ranging from three to ten years). Costs incurred
in purchasing management information systems are capitalized and
included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over
their estimated useful lives from the date the systems become
operational.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company periodically reviews its property and equipment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or
amortization periods should be accelerated. The Company assesses
recoverability based on several factors, including
management&#x2019;s intention with respect to its stores and those
stores&#x2019; projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss
would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of
the assets exceeds their fair value, as approximated by the present
value of their projected cash flows. Impairment losses recorded by
the Company in fiscal 2011 were $11.2 million. Impairment losses
recorded in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were $1.5 million and $1.8
million, respectively.</font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over tangible net
assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company is
required to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets not
subject to amortization for impairment at least annually. This test
is completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter each fiscal
year or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of the
goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired. Goodwill has
been assigned to reporting units for the purpose of impairment
testing. The Company has four business segments, the United States,
Australia, Canada and Europe, which also define our reporting units
based upon the similar economic characteristics of operations
within each segment, including the nature of products, product
distribution and the type of customer and separate management
within those regions. The Company estimates fair value based on the
discounted cash flows of each reporting unit. The Company uses a
two-step process to measure goodwill impairment. If the fair value
of the reporting unit is higher than its carrying value, then
goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting
unit is higher than the fair value, then the second test of
goodwill impairment is needed. The second test compares the implied
fair value of the reporting unit&#x2019;s goodwill with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#x2019;s
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then an impairment loss is
recognized in the amount of the excess. The Company completed its
annual impairment test of goodwill as of the first day of the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 and
concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired. For fiscal 2011,
there was a $3.3 million goodwill impairment charge in the United
States segment as a result of the exiting of a non-core business.
Note&#xA0;9 provides additional information concerning the changes
in goodwill for the consolidated financial statements
presented.</font></p>

Intangible Assets</i></b></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Other intangible assets consist primarily of trade names,
leasehold rights, advertising relationships and amounts attributed
to favorable leasehold interests recorded as a result of business
acquisitions. Intangible assets are recorded apart from goodwill if
they arise from a contractual right and are capable of being
separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented
or exchanged individually. The useful life and amortization
methodology of intangible assets are determined based on the period
in which they are expected to contribute directly to cash flows.
Intangible assets that are determined to have a definite life are
amortized over that period. Leasehold rights which were recorded as
a result of the purchase of SFMI Micromania SAS
&#x201C;Micromania&#x201D; represent the value of rights of tenancy
under commercial property leases for properties located in France.
Rights pertaining to individual leases can be sold by us to a new
tenant or recovered by us from the landlord if the exercise of the
automatic right of renewal is refused. Leasehold rights are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term not
to exceed 20&#xA0;years, with no residual value. Advertising
relationships, which were recorded as a result of digital
acquisitions, are relationships with existing advertisers who pay
to place ads on the Company&#x2019;s digital Web sites and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over 10&#xA0;years. Favorable
leasehold interests represent the value of the contractual monthly
rental payments that are less than the current market rent at
stores acquired as part of the Micromania acquisition or the EB
merger. Favorable leasehold interests are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their remaining lease term with no
expected residual value.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite
life are not amortized, but are required to be evaluated at least
annually for impairment. Trade names which were recorded as a
result of acquisitions, primarily Micromania, are considered
indefinite-lived intangible assets as they are expected to
contribute to cash flows indefinitely and are not subject to
amortization, but are subject to annual impairment testing. If the
carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset
exceeds its fair value as determined by its discounted cash flows,
such individual indefinite-lived intangible asset is written down
by the amount of the excess. The Company completed its annual
impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the
first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 and
concluded that none of its intangible assets were impaired. The
Company completed its annual impairment test of indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2011 and concluded that its Micromania trade name acquired
in connection with the purchase of&#xA0;Micromania was impaired. As
a result, there was an impairment charge for other intangible
assets for fiscal 2011 of $37.8 million. The impairment was
primarily related to a reduction of revenue projections utilized in
the discounted cash flows. The impairment charge is recorded in
asset impairments and restructuring charges in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations and is recorded in the Europe
segment. Note&#xA0;9 provides additional information related to the
Company&#x2019;s intangible assets.</font></p>

a provision for sales returns. The sales return reserve, which
represents the gross profit effect of sales returns, is estimated
based on historical return levels. The sales of used video game
products are recorded at the retail price charged to the customer.
Advertising revenues for <i>Game Informer</i> are recorded upon
release of magazines for sale to consumers. Subscription revenues
for the Company&#x2019;s PowerUp Rewards loyalty program and
magazines are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
subscription period. Revenue from the sales of product replacement
plans is recognized on a straight-line basis over the coverage
period. The deferred revenues for magazine subscriptions and
deferred financing plans are included in accrued liabilities (see
Note&#xA0;8). Gift cards sold to customers are recognized as a
liability on the balance sheet until redeemed.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company sells a variety of digital products which generally

Certain of these products do not require the Company to purchase
inventory or take physical possession of, or take title to,
inventory. When purchasing these products from the Company,
consumers pay a retail price and the Company earns a commission
based on a percentage of the retail sale as negotiated with the

incentives and data on other similar loyalty programs as a basis to
estimate the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. A
weighted-average cost per point redeemed is used to estimate future
redemption costs. The weighted-average cost per point redeemed is
based on the Company&#x2019;s most recent actual costs incurred to
fulfill points that have been redeemed by its loyalty program
members and is adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in
redemption costs, including the mix of rewards redeemed. The
Company continually evaluates its reserve methodology and
assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per
point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate
redemption rate and weighted-average cost per point redeemed have
the effect of either increasing or decreasing the reserve through
the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the

Currency Translation</i></b></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">GameStop has determined that the functional currencies of its
foreign subsidiaries are the subsidiaries&#x2019; local currencies.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at
the applicable exchange rate as of the end of the balance sheet
date and revenue and expenses are translated at an average rate
over the period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income. Transaction gains and
(losses) are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses and amounted to ($0.6)&#xA0;million, $2.5&#xA0;million and
$3.9&#xA0;million for the 52&#xA0;weeks ended January&#xA0;28,
2012, January&#xA0;29, 2011 and January&#xA0;30, 2010,
respectively. The foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
primarily due to the decrease or increase in the value of the
U.S.&#xA0;dollar compared to the functional currencies in the
countries the Company operates in internationally. In fiscal 2011,
the foreign currency transaction losses are primarily due to
volatility in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the
Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and euro. In fiscal 2010, the
foreign currency transaction gains are primarily due to the
decrease in the value of the U.S.&#xA0;dollar compared to the
Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. In fiscal 2009, the
foreign currency transaction gains are primarily due to the
decrease in the value of the U.S.&#xA0;dollar compared to the euro,
the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar.</font></p>

options and cross-currency swaps (together, the &#x201C;Foreign
Currency Contracts&#x201D;) to manage currency risk primarily
related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional
currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.
These Foreign Currency Contracts are not designated as hedges and,
therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are
recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings
