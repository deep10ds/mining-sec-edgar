vote per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.
Holders of Class&#xA0;A common stock will share in any dividend
declared by the Board of Directors, subject to any preferential
rights of any outstanding preferred stock. In the event of the
Company&#x2019;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, all holders
of common stock are entitled to share ratably in any assets
available for distribution to holders of shares of common stock
after payment in full of any amounts required to be paid to holders
of preferred stock.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">In 2005, the Company adopted a rights agreement under which one
right (a &#x201C;Right&#x201D;) is attached to each outstanding share
of the Company&#x2019;s common stock. Each Right entitles the holder
to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of a
series of preferred stock, designated as Series&#xA0;A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (the &#x201C;Series&#xA0;A Preferred
Stock&#x201D;), at a price of $100.00 per one one-thousandth of a
share. The Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group
acquires 15% or more of the voting power of the Company&#x2019;s
outstanding common stock or announces a tender offer or exchange
offer, the consummation of which would result in such person or
group owning 15% or more of the voting power of the Company&#x2019;s
outstanding common stock.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">If a person or group acquires 15% or more of the voting power
of the Company&#x2019;s outstanding common stock, each Right will
entitle a holder (other than such person or any member of such
group) to purchase, at the Right&#x2019;s then current exercise
price, a number of shares of common stock having a market value of
twice the exercise price of the Right. In addition, if the Company
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction
or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold
at any time after the Rights have become exercisable, each Right
will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right&#x2019;s then
current exercise price, a number of the acquiring company&#x2019;s
common shares having a market value at that time of twice the
exercise price of the Right. Furthermore, at any time after a
person or group acquires 15% or more of the voting power of the
outstanding common stock of the Company but prior to the
acquisition of 50% of such voting power, the Board of Directors
may, at its option, exchange part or all of the Rights (other than
Rights held by the acquiring person or group) at an exchange rate
of one one-thousandth of a share of Series&#xA0;A Preferred Stock
or one share of the Company&#x2019;s common stock for each
Right.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company will be entitled to redeem the Rights at any time
prior to the acquisition by a person or group of 15% or more of the
voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company, at a
price of $.01 per Right. The Rights will expire on October&#xA0;28,
2014.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company has 5&#xA0;million shares of $.001&#xA0;par value
preferred stock authorized for issuance, of which 500&#xA0;thousand
shares have been designated by the Board of Directors as
Series&#xA0;A Preferred Stock and reserved for issuance upon
exercise of the Rights. Each such share of Series&#xA0;A Preferred
Stock will be nonredeemable and junior to any other series of
preferred stock the Company may issue (unless otherwise provided in
the terms of such stock) and will be entitled to a preferred
dividend equal to the greater of $1.00 or one thousand times any
dividend declared on the Company&#x2019;s common stock. In the event
of liquidation, the holders of Series&#xA0;A Preferred Stock will
receive a preferred liquidation payment of $1,000.00 per share,
plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and
distributions thereon. Each share of Series&#xA0;A Preferred Stock
will have ten thousand votes, voting together with the
Company&#x2019;s common stock. However, in the event that dividends
on the Series&#xA0;A Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an
amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, holders of the
Series&#xA0;A Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting as a
class, to elect two of the Company&#x2019;s directors. In the event
of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which the
Company&#x2019;s common stock is exchanged, each share of
Series&#xA0;A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive one
thousand times the amount and type of consideration received per
share of the Company&#x2019;s common stock. At January&#xA0;28,
2012, there were no shares of Series&#xA0;A Preferred Stock
outstanding.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">On January&#xA0;11, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company
approved a $300&#xA0;million share repurchase program authorizing
the Company to repurchase its common stock. For fiscal 2009, the
number of shares repurchased was 6.1&#xA0;million for an average
price per share of $20.12. In September 2010, the Board of
Directors of the Company approved an additional $300&#xA0;million
share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase its
common stock. For fiscal 2010, the number of shares repurchased was
17.1&#xA0;million for an average price per share of $19.84.
Approximately $22.0&#xA0;million of treasury share purchases were
not settled at the end of fiscal 2010 and were reported in accrued
liabilities at January&#xA0;29, 2011. Additionally, approximately
$64.6&#xA0;million of treasury share purchases were not settled at
the end of fiscal 2009 and were reported in accrued liabilities at
January&#xA0;30, 2010. In February&#xA0;2011, the Board of
Directors of the Company authorized $500&#xA0;million to be used
for share repurchases of its common stock and/or to retire the
Company&#x2019;s Senior Notes. This plan replaced the
$300&#xA0;million share repurchase program authorized in September
2010 which had $138.4&#xA0;million remaining. In November 2011, the
Board of Directors authorized $500&#xA0;million to be used for
share repurchases and/or retirement of the Company&#x2019;s Senior
Notes, replacing the $180.1 million remaining at the time of the
authorization. For fiscal 2011, the number of shares repurchased
was 11.2&#xA0;million for an average price per share of $21.38. As
of January&#xA0;28, 2012, the Company had $329.7 million remaining
under the November 2011 authorization. As of March&#xA0;22, 2012,
the Company has purchased an additional 3.3&#xA0;million shares for
an average price per share of $22.97. See Note 21 for additional
information on Board authorizations.</font></p>
