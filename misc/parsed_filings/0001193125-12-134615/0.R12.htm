<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company and approximately 50 of its vendors participate in
cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing
programs in which the vendors provide the Company with cash
consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the
vendors&#x2019; products. The Company&#x2019;s accounting for
cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing
programs results in a portion of the consideration received from
the Company&#x2019;s vendors reducing the product costs in inventory
rather than as an offset to the Company&#x2019;s marketing and
advertising costs. The consideration serving as a reduction in
inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. The
amount of vendor allowances to be recorded as a reduction of
inventory was determined by calculating the ratio of vendor
allowances in excess of specific, incremental and identifiable
advertising and promotional costs to merchandise purchases. The
Company then applied this ratio to the value of inventory in
determining the amount of vendor reimbursements to be recorded as a
reduction to inventory reflected on the balance sheet.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing
programs generally cover a period from a few days up to a few weeks
and include items such as product catalog advertising, in-store
display promotions, Internet advertising, co-op print advertising,
product training and promotion at the Company&#x2019;s annual store
managers conference. The allowance for each event is negotiated
with the vendor and requires specific performance by the Company to
be earned.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and
promotional costs were $120.9&#xA0;million, $122.1&#xA0;million and
$93.0&#xA0;million in the 52&#xA0;week periods ended
January&#xA0;28, 2012, January&#xA0;29, 2011 and January&#xA0;30,
2010, respectively. Vendor allowances received in excess of
advertising expenses were recorded as a reduction of cost of sales
of $99.0&#xA0;million, $83.7&#xA0;million and $116.9&#xA0;million
for the 52&#xA0;week periods ended January&#xA0;28, 2012,
January&#xA0;29, 2011 and January&#xA0;30, 2010, respectively. The
amounts deferred as a reduction in inventory were $0.8 million and
$0.7&#xA0;million for the 52&#xA0;weeks ended January&#xA0;28, 2012
and January&#xA0;30, 2010, respectively. The amount recognized as
income related to the capitalization of excess vendor allowances
was $2.1&#xA0;million for the 52&#xA0;weeks ended January&#xA0;29,
2011.</font></p>
