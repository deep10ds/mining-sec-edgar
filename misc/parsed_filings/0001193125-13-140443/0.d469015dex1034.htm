ownership of less than 5% of the publicly traded capital stock of a corporation so long as this is not a controlling interest, or ownership of mutual fund investments. Executive acknowledges and agrees that this subsection (e)&nbsp;is reasonable and

monetary damages that the Company may incur as a result of said breach or threatened breach, in each case without the necessity of posting any bond. The Company may pursue any remedy available, including declaratory relief, concurrently or
consecutively in any order as to any breach, violation, or threatened breach or violation, and the pursuit of one such remedy at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other remedy. </FONT></P>

writing and meet with a Company representative and a neutral mediator (if the Company elects to retain one at its expense) to discuss resolution of any disputes between the parties. Executive will provide this notification at least fourteen
(14)&nbsp;days before Executive engages in any activity on behalf of a Competing Business or engages in other activity that could foreseeably fall within a questioned restriction. The failure to comply with this requirement shall waive
Executive&#146;s right to challenge the reasonable scope, clarity, applicability, or enforceability of the Agreement and its restrictions at a later time. All rights of both parties will be preserved if the Early Resolution Conference requirement is
complied with even if no agreement is reached in the conference. </FONT></P>
