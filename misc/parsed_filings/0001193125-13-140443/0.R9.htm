accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (&#x201C;GAAP&#x201D;) requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing
these financial statements, management has made its best estimates
and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial
statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the
estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant
impact on the Company&#x2019;s financial results. Actual results

carried at cost, which approximates market value, and consist

lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method.
Under the average cost method, as new product is received from
vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product
on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units.
Pre-owned video game products traded in by customers are recorded
as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the
customer. In valuing inventory, management is required to make
assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value
potentially obsolete or over-valued items at the lower of cost or
market. Management considers quantities on hand, recent sales,
potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other
factors, when making these assumptions.</font></p>

upon the Company&#x2019;s ability to forecast customer demand and to
provide a well-balanced merchandise assortment. Inventory is
adjusted based on anticipated physical inventory losses or
shrinkage and actual losses resulting from periodic physical
inventory counts. Inventory reserves as of February&#xA0;2, 2013
and January&#xA0;28, 2012 were $83.8&#xA0;million and

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on furniture, fixtures
and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives ranging from two to ten years. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred, while betterments and major
remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are
capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated
useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including
option periods in which the exercise of the option is reasonably
assured (generally ranging from three to ten years). Costs incurred
in purchasing management information systems are capitalized and
included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over
their estimated useful lives from the date the systems become
operational.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company periodically reviews its property and equipment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or
amortization periods should be accelerated. The Company assesses
recoverability based on several factors, including
management&#x2019;s intention with respect to its stores and those
stores&#x2019; projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss
would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of
the assets exceeds their fair value, as approximated by the present
value of their projected discounted cash flows. Impairment losses
recorded by the Company in fiscal 2012 were $8.8 million.
Impairment losses recorded by the Company in fiscal 2011 and fiscal
2010 were $11.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively.</font></p>

<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2"><b><i>Goodwill</i></b></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over tangible net
assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company is
required to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets not
subject to amortization for impairment at least annually. This
annual test is completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter
each fiscal year or when circumstances indicate the carrying value
of the goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired.
Goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for the purpose of
impairment testing. The Company has four operating segments, the
United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, which also define our
reporting units based upon the similar economic characteristics of
operations within each segment, including the nature of products,
product distribution and the type of customer and separate
management within those regions. The Company estimates the fair
value of each reporting unit based on the discounted cash flows of
each reporting unit. The Company uses a two-step process to measure
any potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the
reporting unit is higher than its carrying value, then goodwill is
not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher
than the fair value, then the second step of the goodwill
impairment test is needed. The second step compares the implied
fair value of the reporting unit&#x2019;s goodwill with its carrying
amount. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in step
two of the goodwill impairment test by allocating the fair value of
the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price
allocation used in a business combination and the residual fair
value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the
reporting unit&#x2019;s goodwill. If the carrying amount of the
reporting unit&#x2019;s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of
its goodwill, then an impairment loss is recognized in the amount
of the excess. If the carrying value of an individual
indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, such
individual indefinite-lived intangible asset is written down by the
amount of the excess. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the
Company determined that sufficient indicators of potential
impairment existed to require an interim goodwill impairment test.
As a result of the interim goodwill impairment test, the Company
recorded non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairments for the
third quarter of fiscal 2012 of $107.1 million, $100.3 million and
$419.6 million in its Australia, Canada and Europe reporting units,
respectively, to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. The Company
completed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of the first
day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, fiscal 2011 and fiscal
2012 and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired. For the
fiscal 2012 annual impairment test, for each of our United States,
Canada and Europe reporting units, the calculated fair value of
each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values by
more than ten percent and the calculated fair value of our
Australia reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by
approximately nine percent. For fiscal 2011, there was a $3.3
million goodwill write-off in the United States segment as a result
of the exiting of a non-core business. Note&#xA0;9 provides
additional information concerning the changes in goodwill for the
consolidated financial statements presented.</font></p>

Intangible Assets</i></b></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Other intangible assets consist primarily of trade names,
leasehold rights, advertising relationships and amounts attributed
to favorable leasehold interests recorded as a result of business
acquisitions. Intangible assets are recorded apart from goodwill if
they arise from a contractual right and are capable of being
separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented
or exchanged individually. The estimated useful life and
amortization methodology of intangible assets are determined based
on the period in which they are expected to contribute directly to
cash flows. Intangible assets that are determined to have a
definite life are amortized over that period. Leasehold rights
which were recorded as a result of the purchase of SFMI Micromania
SAS (&#x201C;Micromania&#x201D;) represent the value of rights of
tenancy under commercial property leases for properties located in
France. Rights pertaining to individual leases can be sold by us to
a new tenant or recovered by us from the landlord if the exercise
of the automatic right of renewal is refused. Leasehold rights are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term not
to exceed 20&#xA0;years, with no residual value. Advertising
relationships, which were recorded as a result of digital
acquisitions, are relationships with existing advertisers who pay
to place ads on the Company&#x2019;s digital Web sites and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over 10&#xA0;years. Favorable
leasehold interests represent the value of the contractual monthly
rental payments that are less than the current market rent at
stores acquired as part of the Micromania acquisition or the EB
merger. Favorable leasehold interests are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their remaining lease term with no
expected residual value.</font></p>

life are not amortized, but are required to be evaluated at least
annually for impairment. Trade names which were recorded as a
result of acquisitions, primarily Micromania, are considered
indefinite-lived intangible assets as they are expected to
contribute to cash flows indefinitely and are not subject to
amortization, but are subject to annual impairment testing. If the
carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset
exceeds its fair value as determined by its discounted cash flows,
such individual indefinite-lived intangible asset is written down
by the amount of the excess.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company determined
that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to
require an interim impairment test of its Micromania trade name. As
a result of the interim impairment test of the Micromania trade
name, the Company recorded a $44.9 million impairment charge during
the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The Company completed its annual
impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the
first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2010 and
concluded that none of its intangible assets were impaired. The
Company completed its annual impairment test of indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2011 and concluded that its Micromania trade name was
impaired due to revenue forecasts that had declined since the
initial valuation. As a result, the Company recorded a $37.8
million impairment charge for fiscal 2011. The impairment charges
are recorded in asset impairments and restructuring charges in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations and are recorded
in the Europe segment. Note&#xA0;9 provides additional information

recognized at the time of sale, net of sales discounts, reduced by
a provision for sales returns. The sales return reserve, which
represents the gross profit effect of sales returns, is estimated
based on historical return levels. The sales of pre-owned video
game products are recorded at the retail price charged to the
customer. Advertising revenues for <i>Game Informer</i> are
recorded upon release of magazines for sale to consumers.
Subscription revenues for the Company&#x2019;s PowerUp Rewards
loyalty program and magazines are recognized on a straight-line

under the loyalty program, prior experience with other customer
incentives and data on other similar loyalty programs as a basis to
estimate the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. A
weighted-average cost per point redeemed is used to estimate future
redemption costs. The weighted-average cost per point redeemed is
based on the Company&#x2019;s most recent actual costs incurred to
fulfill points that have been redeemed by its loyalty program
members and is adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in
redemption costs, including the mix of rewards redeemed. The
Company continually evaluates its reserve methodology and
assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per
point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate
redemption rate and weighted-average cost per point redeemed have

international income taxes. Income taxes are accounted for
utilizing an asset and liability approach and deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of
temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the
tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the
enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be
realized. In accordance with GAAP, we maintain accruals for
uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is
completed by the applicable taxing authority, available review
periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to
change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount (see
Note&#xA0;13).</font></p>

permanently reinvested, no provision for United States income or

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company leases retail stores, warehouse facilities, office
space and equipment. These are generally leased under noncancelable
agreements that expire at various dates through 2034 with various
renewal options for additional periods. The agreements, which have
been classified as operating leases, generally provide for minimum
and, in some cases, percentage rentals and require the Company to
pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs. Leases with
step rent provisions, escalation clauses or other lease concessions
are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term,
which includes renewal option periods when the Company is
reasonably assured of exercising the renewal options and includes
&#x201C;rent holidays&#x201D; (periods in which the Company is not
obligated to pay rent). Cash or lease incentives received upon
entering into certain store leases (&#x201C;tenant improvement
allowances&#x201D;) are recognized on a straight-line basis as a
reduction to rent expense over the lease term, which includes
renewal option periods when the Company is reasonably assured of
exercising the renewal options. We record the unamortized portion
of tenant improvement allowances as a part of deferred rent. The
Company does not have leases with capital improvement funding.
Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of
specified minimums at various stores and are accounted for in the
period in which the amount of percentage rentals can be accurately
estimated.</font></p>

foreign subsidiaries are the subsidiaries&#x2019; local currencies.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at
the applicable exchange rate as of the end of the balance sheet
date and revenue and expenses are translated at an average rate
over the period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income. Transaction gains and
(losses) are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses and were $2.5&#xA0;million, $(0.6)&#xA0;million and
$2.5&#xA0;million for the 53&#xA0;weeks ended February&#xA0;2, 2013
and the 52 weeks ended January&#xA0;28, 2012 and January&#xA0;29,
2011, respectively. The foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are primarily due to the decrease or increase in the value
of the U.S.&#xA0;dollar compared to the functional currencies in
the countries the Company operates in internationally. The foreign
currency transaction gains and (losses) are primarily due to
volatility in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the
Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and euro.</font></p>

options and cross-currency swaps (together, the &#x201C;Foreign
Currency Contracts&#x201D;) to manage currency risk primarily
related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional
currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.
These Foreign Currency Contracts are not designated as hedges and,
therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are
recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings

regarding disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income by component. An entity is required to
present either on the face of the statement of operations or in the
notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other
comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but
only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to
net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For
amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity
is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide
additional detail about those amounts. This accounting standard
update is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods
beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2012. The Company is evaluating
the effect this accounting standard update will have on its
consolidated financial statements.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">In July 2012, an accounting standard update was issued related
to testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The
purpose of the update is to simplify the guidance for testing
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and the update
permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment
test. Unless an entity determines, through its qualitative
assessment, that it is more likely than not that an
indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, it would not be
required to calculate the fair value of the asset. This standard is
effective for annual and interim impairment tests of
indefinite-lived intangible assets performed in fiscal years
beginning after September&#xA0;15, 2012, and early adoption is
permitted. This standard did not have an impact on our annual
indefinite-lived asset impairment testing process in fiscal 2012 as
we did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment. The adoption
of this guidance may result in a change in how we perform our
goodwill impairment assessment; however, it will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" align="justify"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted the

changes in stockholders&#x2019; equity be presented either in a
single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two
separate, but consecutive statements. In connection with the
adoption of this accounting standard update, our consolidated
financial statements now include separate consolidated statements
