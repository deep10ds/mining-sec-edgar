STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In order to maintain the highest degree of integrity in the conduct of the Company&#146;s business and your independent judgment, you must avoid any activity or personal interest that creates, or appears
to create a conflict, between your interests and the interests of the Company. A conflict of interest occurs when your private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to interfere, with the interests of the Company as a whole. You should
conduct the Company&#146;s business in an honest and ethical manner, and never act in a manner that could cause you to lose your independence and objectivity. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Although we cannot list every conceivable conflict, the following are some common examples that illustrate actual or apparent conflicts of interest that should be avoided: </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>&#149; Improper Personal Benefits from the Company </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Conflicts of interest arise when an officer or a member of his or her family or household member receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company. You may not accept
any benefits from the Company that have not been duly authorized and approved pursuant to Company policy and procedure, including any Company loans or guarantees of your personal obligations. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>&#149; Financial Interests in Other Businesses </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Neither you nor your immediate family or household members may have an ownership interest in any other enterprise if that interest compromises or appears to compromise your loyalty to the Company. For
example, you may not own an interest in a company that competes with the Company. You may not own an interest in a company that does business with the Company (such as a Company customer/client or supplier) unless you obtain the written approval of
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors before making any such investment. However, it is not typically considered a conflict of interest to make investments with a total value of no more than ten percent (10%)&nbsp;of your annual compensation
in customers/clients or suppliers that are listed on a recognized securities exchange. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>&#149; Business Arrangements
with the Company and Corporate Opportunities </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Without the prior written approval of the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors, you may not participate in a joint venture, partnership or other business arrangement with the Company. If you learn of a business or investment opportunity through the use of corporate property or information or through your position at
the Company &#151; such as from a competitor, actual or potential client, supplier or business associate of the Company (including a principal, officer, director or employee of any of the above), you may not participate in the business or make the
investment. You must, instead, inform the Chief Executive Officer (or, with respect to the Chief Executive Officer, inform the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors). Such an opportunity is an investment opportunity for the Company, not for you
individually. </FONT></P>

obtain Audit Committee approval for your service as a director on up to three boards on which you serve as of the effective date of this Code of Ethics, provided that you notify the Board of Directors of such directorships. Similarly, you must
obtain the prior written approval of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors before running for election or seeking appointment to any government-related position. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT

spouse or significant other, your children, parents, or in-laws, or someone else with whom you have a familial or household relationship is, or is to be, a competitor, supplier or customer/client of the Company or is, or is to be, employed by one,
you must disclose the situation to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors so that the Company may assess the nature and extent of any concern and how it can be resolved. You must carefully guard against inadvertently disclosing Company
confidential information and being involved in decisions on behalf of the Company that involve such other company. </FONT></P>
