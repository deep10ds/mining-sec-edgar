previously have. In exchange for the foregoing and the additional terms agreed to in this

Company&#146;s clients, customers and other business contacts by Executive during past employment with
the Company is now the exclusive property of the Company, and will be used only for the benefit of
the Company, whether previously so agreed or not. Executive expressly waives and releases any

training, or Confidential Information, that was previously received or developed by Executive while
working for the Company for the benefit of any competing person or entity.

Confidential Information furnished to Executive by any representative of the Company or otherwise
acquired or developed by him in connection with his association with the Company (collectively,

hours of the termination of his relationship with the Company, Executive promises to return to the
Company any Recipient Materials that are in his possession, custody or control, regardless of
whether such Materials are located in Executive&#146;s office, automobile, or home or on Executive&#146;s
business or personal computers. Executive also shall authorize and permit the Company to inspect
all computer drives used or maintained by Executive during his employment or consulting at the
Company and, if necessary, to permit the Company to delete any Recipient Materials or Proprietary
Information contained on such drives.

later challenge any provision as unclear, unenforceable or inapplicable to any competitive activity
that Executive intends to engage in, Executive will first notify the Company in writing and meet
with a Company representative and a neutral mediator (if the Company elects to retain one at its
expense) to discuss resolution of any disputes between the parties. Executive will provide this
